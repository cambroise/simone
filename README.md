# SIMoNe: Statistical Inference for Modular Networks

> The goals of SIMoNe is to implement methods for the inference of
> co-expression networks based on partial correlation coefficients from
> either steady-state or time-course transcriptomic data. Note that with
> both type of data this package can deal with samples collected in
> different experimental conditions and therefore not identically
> distributed. In this particular case, multiple but related networks
> are inferred on one simone run.
