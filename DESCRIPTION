Description: Implements the inference of
    co-expression networks based on partial correlation
    coefficients from either steady-state or time-course
    transcriptomic data. Note that with both type of data this
    package can deal with samples collected in different
    experimental conditions and therefore not identically
    distributed. In this particular case, multiple but related
    networks are inferred on one simone run.
